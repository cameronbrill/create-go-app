# create-go-app

This is an executable to create different base projects I tend to use. Inspired by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

# installation

Make sure you have your `go/bin` added to your `PATH` variable, such as in your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`

```
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

In your terminal, run this command

```
go install github.com/cameronbrill/create-go-app@latest
```
